Drinking fresh juices can <span> detoxify the body</span> , help to <span> create a more alkaline body</span> , and to <span> give a boost of energy and a clear mind</span> .</p> <p> Juicing is a powerful tactic used by a quickly-growing amount of people to lose weight fast, get proper nutrition, and help fuel healthy lifestyles.</p> <p> Whenever I come from vacation or a particularly bad eating night, I reach for a healthy juice to cleanse my body and give my digestive system a break.</p> <p> I am sharing 4 of our favorite juicing recipes with an assortment of fruits and vegetables for variety. Since my oldest daughter is a &#8220;health freak&#8221; we make these homemade juices every week and store them in jars in the refrigerator to make them easily accessible. <span> It saves SO much money juicing at home!</span> </p> <p> </p> <h2> <span> What are the health benefits of juicing?</span> </h2> <p> According to the Mayo Clinic, by drinking freshly made juices, your body can absorb the nutrients better than eating whole fruits and vegetables and it gives your digestive system a rest from working on fiber. They say that juicing can reduce your risk of cancer, boost your immune system, help remove toxins from your body, aid digestion and help you lose weight. Fresh juices can give you a burst of energy and a clear mind.</p> <h2> <span> What fruits and vegetables to use for juicing?</span> </h2> <p> Some of the most popular vegetables are carrots, cucumber, celery, kale, spinach, beets, and romaine. The most popular fruits to use in juicing are lemons, oranges, apples, and limes. Other add-ins are fresh ginger, parsley, chlorella, and turmeric.</p> <h2> <span> What are the health benefits of fruits and vegetables in a juice cleanse?</span> </h2> <strong> Kale</strong> – insanely low in calories, powerful anti-oxidant with anti-inflammatory properties, and helpful for arthritis and autoimmune diseases <strong> Spinach</strong> – the beauty of spinach lies in how easy it is to disguise the taste. It’s mild tasting yet packed with vitamins, has anti-cancerous properties, and is one of the healthiest foods on the planet <strong> Cucumber</strong> – since it’s 95% water, it’s an incredible detoxifier and helps with liver and kidney function <strong> Lemon</strong> – one of the most important items to stock in your kitchen as it’s a highly effective cleansing agent and cuts through the bitterness of greens <strong> Carrots</strong> known for being a good source of beta-carotene, fiber, vitamin K, and potassium. Carrots have been linked to lower cholesterol levels and improved eye health <p> </p> <strong> Celery</strong> low in calories since it is mostly water. It is a low-glycemic food and a good source of dietary fiber, Vitamin A, Vitamin C, and Vitamin K. <strong> Beets</strong> <span> contain nutrients that may help lower your blood pressure, fight inflammation, and support detoxification. </span> <strong> Apples</strong> &#8220;an apple a day keeps the doctor away&#8221; is a famous saying for good reason. Helps to fight inflammation and heart health. <strong> Oranges</strong> immune system booster since it is high in Vitamin C and low in calories. <strong> Turmeric</strong> – anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties <strong> Ginger</strong> – aids in digestion and supports the immune system <p> If you are looking for a real detoxifier,<strong> <span> check out my recipe for a lemon turmeric drink </span> </strong> , which is perfect after a night of bad eating.</p> <p> If you are searching for blended fruit and vegetable smoothie recipes, <strong> <span> click HERE to find my post with 6 Superfood Smoothie Recipes </span> </strong> . I went on a 30-day smoothie and juice cleanse to help with my autoimmune disease. You can find out <strong> <span> more details in this post .</span> </strong> </p> <h2> <span> Where to buy a juicer?</span> </h2> <p> There are many juicers on the market and I have been so impressed with our <strong> <span> Breville juicer</span> </strong> . If you are looking for a <strong> <span> compact, less-expensive Breville juicer, you can find it here</span> </strong> .</p> <p> </p> <h3> Here are the fruit and vegetable juice combinations below:</h3> <span> <strong> Drink Your Greens</strong> </span> : Spinach, Cucumber, Celery, Lemon, Ginger, and Apple (optional: parsley) <strong> <span> The Detoxifier</span> </strong> : Beets, Carrots, Lemon, Ginger, Apple <strong> <span> The Vision</span> </strong> : Carrots, Oranges, Ginger (optional: turmeric) <strong> <span> Sweet Carrot</span> </strong> : Apples, Carrots, and Parsley <p> </p> <p> I love to hear from you!

It is important to pay attention to what your body is telling you; if you only treat your symptoms, the real problem will go unchecked. Health issues like constipation, gas, bloating, headaches, fatigue, and even hair loss could be signs that your colon is not functioning properly.</p> Reply <p> <span> christine jimenez</span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> October 9, 2020 at 11:56 AM </p> <p> Hello! Would you happen to have a sample juice cleanse menu on which to take when that is safe and effective? Thank you so much</p> Reply <p> <span> Angela Fisher</span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> October 21, 2020 at 8:44 AM </p> <p> Hello Melissa. Just tried the Detoxifier. It is DELICIOUS! This is my first time juicing. I&#8217;m hooked. Can&#8217;t wait to try the others.</p> Reply <p> <span> AmyF</span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> January 14, 2021 at 11:55 AM </p> <p> Hi Angela. How many cups of juice did this make?</p> Reply <p> <span> shawon emdad</span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> October 23, 2020 at 5:16 AM </p> <p> Great article about healthy juice recipes. Thanks for sharing your juicing experience.</p> Reply <p> <span> Misha</span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> October 30, 2020 at 11:07 PM </p> <p> <br/> I just bought a juicer for the first time and googled a recipe and here I am! I had everything for the Green Juice! I was so scared to try it; assuming it would be bitter and nasty. My children were cracking jokes through the entire process and were watching me like hawk as I took my first sip .it was so mild and pleasant and tolerable!!!!! Hallelujah, I will be able to be healthy and ingest the most vegetables my body has ever had, thanks to your recipe! You Rock! Thank You!!</p> Reply <p> <span> Catherine Barry Miroballi</span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> December 28, 2020 at 10:47 AM </p> <p> I just got a Breville juicer for Christmas and am so excited to be juicing my way through 2021!!!

If I stick to them I loose weight easily. And a huge bonus is they taste great!</p> Reply <p> <span> LaShunda Jones</span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> January 16, 2021 at 6:11 PM </p> <p> Hello, how many ounces does one of the juice recipes make? I want to try to juice for an entire day. Thank you.</p> Reply <p> <span> Tina Herz</span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> January 2, 2021 at 9:00 AM </p> <p> Does each recipe serve 4? Or is each recipe 1 Serving?</p> Reply <p> <span> Bibi</span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> January 5, 2021 at 10:13 PM </p> <p> This is very helpful. I knew of some of these but now I know which ones I should be putting together.

Super new to juicing</p> Reply <p> <span> Stéphane</span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> January 17, 2021 at 3:28 PM </p> <p> Hello, and welcome to the world of juicing. It is always best to remove the peel before juicing a lemon am as it will be quite bitter. Enjoy the benefits of juicing.</p> Reply <p> <span> nate</span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> April 3, 2021 at 2:43 AM </p> <p> Use Bragg Organic Apple Cider Vinegar in lieu of lemon.</p> Reply <p> <span> Kristi</span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> January 17, 2021 at 8:55 AM </p> <p> When juicing parsley or mint I don&#8217;t get much juice.. And find almost intact leaves in the pulp bin?? Any suggestions?</p> Reply <p> <span> nate</span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> April 3, 2021 at 2:35 AM </p> <p> Parsley simply cannot be juiced by using &#8216;regular&#8217; juicers due to its tough fibre.</p> <p> Norwalk Juicer can juice anything but it&#8217;s pricey and heavy [about 60 lbs]. But it&#8217;s the best juicer, cream of the crop, I know of and own one.</p> <p> Try other veggies that are equal to parsley in terms of health benefits. But do not juice fruits period.</p> Reply <p> <span> brooklyn</span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> January 17, 2021 at 8:00 PM </p> <p> Hi there! I would love to try out these juices! We do have a juicer, but its a bit of a pain to clean, (or maybe i&#8217;m just too lazy haha) so would it work in a blender? We have a vitamix, so its pretty strong. To make it smoother, using a fine mesh strainer would probably help, too. What are your thoughts? 🙂</p> Reply <p> <span> Femina Jaffer</span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> May 6, 2021 at 11:47 AM </p> <p> To juice leafy vegetables, you would need to use masticating juicers. I have the OMEGA and its great; but, there are cheaper ones on Amazon with great reviews.</p> <p> Another option, but more work. Make your juice in your juicer, then add in the blender with the spinach.</p> Reply <p> <span> Matilda</span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> February 12, 2021 at 7:56 PM </p> <p> <br/> Tried the 4 juice recipes due to trying to be healthier, I have an extensive medical history and I am desperate to feel better. So I found you modern honey!! And let me tell you it was the best thing ever, I went and bought the Breville 3x juicer, best investment ever!! I tried all 4 juice recipes and they are amazing 👏😋. Thank you for creating these!! Truly a life saver!! I definitely feel the difference.</p> Reply <p> <span> Imelda</span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> February 21, 2021 at 4:23 PM </p> <p> Hi, is each recipe quantity for 4 people? Just wondering as that’s a lot of juice for one person. Or is each recipe for one person? Just need to clarify, thanks. Great recipes thanks for providing</p> Reply <p> <span> Patricia O'Toole</span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> February 23, 2021 at 10:36 AM </p> <p> I was wondering this myself.</p> Reply <p> <span> Imelda</span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> February 23, 2021 at 10:08 PM </p> <p> Hi Patricia I found out if you follow the quantities but also depending on how big your vegetables and fruit are, each recipe is for 4 serves. I found it made roughly about 1 litre so each serve is 250mls but of course if you use really big beetroots or carrots then it will make more.</p> Reply <p> <span> Patricia</span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> February 24, 2021 at 7:13 PM </p> <p> Sorry, to clarify is this recipe 4 separate drinks? Or do we mix these all together making 1 litre of juice?</p> Reply <p> <span> Imelda</span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> February 27, 2021 at 12:00 AM </p> <p> <br/> Sorry my reply comment is below she has provided 4 different recipes that provide 4 serves each.</p> <p> <span> Imelda</span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> February 25, 2021 at 7:40 PM </p> <p> She has provided 4 different recipes and each recipe is for 4 servings.</p> Reply <p> <span> Imelda</span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> February 27, 2021 at 12:01 AM </p> <p> <br/> Amazing juices, I’m having the sweet carrot juice, once again thank you for sharing these juice recipes</p> Reply <p> <span> Imelda</span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> March 2, 2021 at 12:25 AM </p> <p> <br/> Having the Vision juice it is DELICIOUS!

Do you know what the calories are per 250ml for each recipe? Thanks for your time.<br/> Imelda</p> Reply <p> <span> Kylie</span> <span> says</span> </p> <p> April 2, 2021 at 7:56 AM </p> <p> <br/> The Detoxifier juice works so well for me.
