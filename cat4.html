I&#8217;m also going to say that you don&#8217;t even need to do a juice cleanse with the juicing recipes that I&#8217;m going to provide you with. You can simply choose to add one or two of these juices to your diet each day to help boost your energy and nutrition. That&#8217;s what I tend to do. I enjoy one of these juices along with a celery juice since I&#8217;m one of those people who tends not to eat my veggies nearly as much as I should.</p> <h2> Which Juicer to Buy?</h2> I use this  Breville Cold Juicer  at home. It’s easy to clean and fairly quiet. If you’re looking for a more affordable juicer,  this one  gets great reviews. <p> <strong> If you would like to do a juice cleanse, these healthy juicing recipes are just what you need to get started. </strong> </p> <p> I have done a few juice cleanses over the past couple years. My first two were done with juices that I purchased from a local juice producer here in Portland. But you know what? It&#8217;s super expensive. So, I finally invested in a juicer and learned that it&#8217;s super easy and just as delicious (if not more) to make create your own healthy juicing recipes at home.</p> <p> During a typical juice cleanse, I&#8217;ll drink 6 glasses of juice a day and plenty of water. I&#8217;ve also found it helpful to supplement my juice cleanse with some homemade bone broth that I make in the slow cooker or instant pot, just because I find myself craving something warm, especially during the cooler months. Hot tea is another option to add on to your juice cleanse.</p> <p> You can also supplement your juice cleanse with this Weight Loss Soup that can be made in the instant pot or on the stove.</p> <h3> Here&#8217;s what a typical day of a juice cleanse looks like:</h3> 8am Celery Juice + Water 10am Carrot Ginger Juice + Water 12pm Green Juice + Bone Broth + Water 2pm Beet Juice + Water 4pm Green Juice + Water 6pm Grapefruit Mint Juice + Water 8pm Bone Broth + Water <p> I like to purchase my fruits and vegetables on Sunday and prep them all. Then, during the week, I like to prepare the individual juices each day, for optimal freshness. It&#8217;s said that juice is at its peak nutrition when you consume it within 15-minutes of being prepared, but 24-hours is great too. In fact, these juices will keep for up to three days in the refrigerator.</p> <p> </p> <h2> Best Vegetables for Juicing</h2> Kale Celery Spinach Cucumber Beets Carrots <h2> Best Fruits for Juicing</h2> Apples Pineapple Grapefruit Orange Lemon <h2> How Many Days Should You Juice Cleanse?</h2> <p> <strong> 1 Day </strong> This is great for beginners and perfect to give your body a reset after a particularly indulgent weekend.</p> <p> <strong> 3 Days </strong> A three-day juice cleanse will help eliminate toxins, boost energy, stimulate weight loss and benefit your immune system. This is the duration that I generally stick with.</p> <p> <strong> 5-7 Days </strong> Need an extra nutritional boost. Try a five to seven day cleanse to further eliminate toxins. It&#8217;s particularly useful in times of high stress.</p> <h2> 3 Day Juice Cleanse Recipes</h2> <h3> <strong> BEET JUICE // </strong> Beet, Carrot, Apple, Lemon</h3> <h3> <strong> CARROT GINGER JUICE</strong> // Carrot, Orange, Ginger, Turmeric, Cayenne</h3> <h3> <strong> GRAPEFRUIT MINT JUICE</strong> // Grapefruit, Ginger, Mint</h3> <h3> <strong> GREEN JUICE</strong>  // Kale, Pineapple, Apple, Celery</h3> <h3> <strong> DETOX CELERY JUICE</strong> </h3> <h2> What Should I Eat After a Juice Cleanse?</h2> <p> After a juice cleanse, you should aim to slowly introduce your body to normal food. Start with lots of fresh fruits and vegetables and be sure to drink plenty of water. Then, I like to introduce healthy grains like quinoa or farro, and light proteins like fish and chicken.</p> <h3> Looking for some healthy recipes to ease you out of your juice cleanse?

It&#8217;s so much cheaper to do a DIY one at home but sometimes you just need the convenience of bottles. Green juice #2 is my jam though so good.</p> <p> Reply </p> Catherine @ To &amp; Fro Fam March 19, 2019 at 12:19 pm <p> <br/> The colors alone make me want to drink up!

It seems to be the most mild </p> <p> Reply </p> Mary March 19, 2019 at 4:57 pm <p> <br/> I think it&#8217;s time for me to get a juicer! I find myself using my blender, then straining some of the tough fibers, which is a total pain! And the amount I spend on store-bought juices (which run $4-$7) could pay for a juicer by the end of the year. Thanks for all the great tips and inspiration!</p> <p> Reply </p> Erin March 20, 2019 at 8:19 pm <p> You are so welcome Mary! It&#8217;s definitely an investment, but I think it pays for itself if you juice a lot.</p> <p> Reply </p> Home Plix September 4, 2019 at 4:39 am <p> <br/> Amazing healthy juice recipe.

Do they stain all the plastic part of your juicer too? I&#8217;m on my 2nd cup (did celery and carrot ginger just now) and I&#8217;m really not used to it. It&#8217;s a bit gross.. the rawness taste how long will it take for me to overcome it? I feel a bit nauseated lol..</p> <p> Reply </p> Sherry August 15, 2020 at 3:42 pm <p> Confused on servings!

What you&#8217;re all spending tons of money on is called STOCK. Stock is a liquid made from slowly simmering(barely) the BONES of am animal (usually beef, chicken, veal, or fish) for anywhere from 2-12 hours. A broth on the other hand is made from the MEAT of an animal. So once again BONE BROTH doesn&#8217;t exist.</p> <p> Reply </p> April February 18, 2021 at 7:20 am <p> Interesting. So does that mean it&#8217;s supposed to be called bone stock?</p> <p> Reply </p> Gisselle moreno March 11, 2021 at 1:24 am <p> What Can I replace the apples with?
