Here are 6 of the best juicing recipes to get you started with fresh. juice. These healthy juice recipes are lower in sugar, making them excellent for weight loss, detox, and wellness. </p> <h2> </h2> <p> I&#8217;ve been a smoothie girl since I was little kids, but over the years have grown to love juices too. Because sweet fruit juices are so high in calories and sugar and cause a blood sugar spike, I opt for green juices with little to no fruit added. </p> <p> The nutrition and energy from a freshly pressed juice is so much better than from a cup of coffee in the afternoon. Unlike smoothies , when juicing, the produce is stripped of its fiber, so it won&#8217;t be as filling, and shouldn&#8217;t be considered a meal. I think of juicing recipes as natural, homemade supplements. </p> <p> <span> </span> </p> <h2> </h2> <h2> Best Juicers </h2> <p> There are plenty of juicers to fit every budget and lifestyle. Here are some top-rated juicers. Just so you know, these are affiliate links, which means I may earn a commission when you shop through them. </p> High End: This Slow Juicer from AICOK has amazing reviews. Midrange: Breville Juice Fountain Compact Centrifugal Juicer is the juicer I have, shown above. I find it easy to use and clean, and efficient. Affordable: Here&#8217;s a highly rated fruit and veggie juicer for just under $40 on Amazon Prime. <h2> Juicing Without a Juicer</h2> <p> If you don&#8217;t own a juicer, that&#8217;s okay, you can still make fresh juice! High quality juicers can be expensive. If you&#8217;re going to buy either a juicer or a blender, I&#8217;d go with blender. </p> To make juice in a blender, add the ingredients to the blender and blend on the lowest setting. Slowly add just enough water to turn the blender. Puree until completely smooth, adding more water to thin as necessary. Pour through a fine mesh sieve set over a wide mouth jar or bowl. Use cheesecloth or a nut milk bag for a thinner juice. <h2> </h2> <h2> Best Vegetables &amp; Fruits to Juice</h2> Carrots Celery Tomatoes Beets Cucumber Kale Dandelion greens Spinach Romaine Parsley Wheatgrass Broccoli Sprouts Apples Citrus Berries Ginger Turmeric <h2> Vegetables to Avoid Juicing</h2> Potatoes and sweet potatoes Mushrooms Eggplant Turnips <h2> </h2> <h2> Tips for Healthy Juicing</h2> Choose organic produce whenever possible. If you can&#8217;t find organic, peel dirty dozen ingredients and/or wash well. Always peel citrus fruits as the pith is bitter. You don&#8217;t need to remove the stems from greens or herbs, just wash and trim and bad bits. Following drier ingredients like herbs or ginger with watery ingredients like cucumber helps to extract as much of the juice as possible and push things through the juicer. Freshly pressed juice should be consumed immediately. If you must save it for later, save for no more than 24-48 house in the fridge. <h2> Healthy Juicing Recipes for Weight Loss, Detox, and Wellness</h2> <p> Here are six fantastic juicing recipe combinations to get you started. They are lower in sugar and high in phytonutrients. Feel free to mix and match, or come up with your juicing recipe own combinations. </p> <h2> </h2> <h3> Green Juice</h3> ginger cucumber kale parsley celery stalks pineapple chunks lemon <h2> </h2> <h3> Roots</h3> beet lemon ginger apple <h2> </h2> <h3> Carrot Orange Turmeric </h3> carrots orange turmeric ginger lemon pinch black pepper <h2> </h2> <h3> Popeye&#8217;s Punch</h3> spinach or kale carrots beet cucumber <h2> </h2> <h3> Spicy Lemon Cleanse </h3> ginger peeled cayenne pepper stevia to taste water <h2> </h2> <h3> Pink Grapefruit</h3> pink grapefruit orange pineapple mint <h2> </h2> <h2> More Healthy Juice Recipes to Try</h2> Beet Juice Apple Cider From Scratch Passion Fruit Juice Carrot Orange Turmeric Juice C ranberry Juice Detox Water Best Detox Drinks Lemon Apple Cider Vinegar Drink Elderberry Tea Apple Cider Vinegar Shots Ginger Shots Turmeric Shots Aloe Vera Juice <h2> What to Do With Juicing Pulp</h2> <p> Juicing can feel wasteful because there is so much pulp left over, but you don&#8217;t have to throw it away. Juiced vegetable pulp can be added to stocks and soups, while fruit pulp can be added to quick breads, muffins, and granola. </p> <h2> Juice Cleanse Recipes for Weight Loss or Detox</h2> <p> I personally consider juice a supplement, rather than a meal. However, I have many friends who swear by doing a juice fast or cleanse ever year. You can get a 3-day juice cleanse package at Pressed Juicery, among other places, or DIY it. </p> <p> When choosing juicing recipes for weight loss, look for lower sugar options to avoid a blood sugar spike from consuming fruit juice. </p> <p> Sources consulted for this post: </p> <p> Pressed Juicery </p> <p> Lazy Acres Market </p> <p> <span> How to Cook Everything Vegetarian , by Mark Bittman </span> </p> Continue to Content <span> Yield: 1 Serving</span> <h2> 6 Juicing Recipes </h2> <strong> Prep Time</strong> <span> <span> 5 minutes</span> </span> <strong> Cook Time</strong> <span> <span> 2 minutes</span> </span> <strong> Total Time</strong> <span> <span> 7 minutes</span> </span> <p> Juicing organic vegetables is an easy way to consume the micronutrients from a large amount of fresh produce. Here are 6 of the best juicing recipes to get you started. These healthy juice recipes are lower in sugar, making them excellent for weight loss, detox, and wellness.  </p> <h3> Ingredients</h3> <h4> Green Juice</h4> 1/2 inch ginger  1 large cucumber  1/2 bunch kale  1/4 cup parsley  2 large celery stalks  1/2 cup pineapple chunks 1/4 peeled lemon <h4> Roots</h4> 1 beet 1/4 peeled lemon 1/2 inch ginger 1 apple  <h4> Carrot Orange Turmeric </h4> 4 carrots 1 small orange, peeled 1/2 turmeric 1/2 inch ginger  1/4 peeled lemon pinch black pepper  <h4> Popeye s  Punch</h4> 1/2 bunch spinach 3 carrots 1 beet 1/2 cucumber  <h4> Spicy Lemon Cleanse </h4> 1/2 inch ginger  2 lemons, peeled pinch cayenne pepper  stevia to taste  1 1/2 cups water <h4> Pink Grapefruit</h4> 1 pink grapefruit, peeled 1 small orange, peeled  1/2 cup pineapple chunks 6 mint leaves <h3> Instructions</h3> Set up your juicer and prepare any ingredients you are using. Wash your produce well and peel anything that is not organic. Add the ingredients for your preferred juice to the feed tube of the juicer, starting with the driest ingredients and following with the most watery, as this will help move ingredients through. Turn on the juicer, following the manufacturer's instructions. There may be foam at the top of your juice. This is normal and you can scoop it off with a spoon if you'd like. Enjoy your fresh juice immediately, as this is the time it will have the most nutrients. Furthermore, fresh juices tend to separate when stored. I like to serve homemade juices over ice. If you must save for later, you can keep your juice in an airtight jar in the refrigerator for up to 24-48 hours. <h6> <span> Nutrition Information:</span> </h6> <span> <span> Yield:</span> 2</span> <span> <span> Serving Size:</span> 1/2 green juice recipe</span> <br> <span> Amount Per Serving: </span> <span> <span> Calories:</span> 90</span> <span> <span> Total Fat:</span> 1g</span> <span> <span> Saturated Fat:</span> 0g</span> <span> <span> Trans Fat:</span> 0g</span> <span> <span> Unsaturated Fat:</span> 0g</span> <span> <span> Cholesterol:</span> 0mg</span> <span> <span> Sodium:</span> 71mg</span> <span> <span> Carbohydrates:</span> 21g</span> <span> <span> Fiber:</span> 4g</span> <span> <span> Sugar:</span> 13g</span> <span> <span> Protein:</span> 3g</span> <p> Nutrition information is automatically calculated by Nutritionix.
